Bower and backbone steps

go to the directory of your project

type in bower init
this creates the bower.json file

asks for
	name
	version
	desciption
	main file - if you don't have one just hit enter (not html files, more like libraries)
	what types of modules does this package expose? (can leave this blank)
	keywords - so people can search stuff
	author -	Carlos Marra (findme@carlosamarra.com)
	license - MIT
	homepage - url
	set currently installed components as dependencies (dont have any)
	add commonly ignored files (basically github stuff, usually yes)
	
	would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being 				
	accidentally published to the registry? usually no
	
	looks good?

so now that we are set up, install stuff

	when installing stuff make sure to add it to json file by putting --save after each command
		
		example - bower install polymer --save

	after the first one, bow will create a folder called bower-components, where the installed files actually go

	if a dependency also has a bower json file, bower will automatically get what the library needs and puts 
	it in the bower-compenets folder


creating our first element
	
	refer to index.html


	to get a list of links to import it into your html file, use bower list --paths

starting a local server (assumption is without xampp or wamp)

	if you use node, you can npm install -g serve
	this will install a little server
	then type serve to start a serve on port 3000

to access website

	localhost:3000 on chrome address bar
